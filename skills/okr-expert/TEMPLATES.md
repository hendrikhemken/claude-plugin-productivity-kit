## 🔄 Weekly Cadence (Wodtke Style)

### Monday Commitments (15 min)
**"What are we doing THIS WEEK for these OKRs?"**

- Update confidence level (0.0-1.0) for each KR
- Pick 1-3 concrete actions per KR
- Write down commitments

### Friday Celebrations (15 min)
**"What did we accomplish? What did we learn?"**

- Mark wins (even small ones!)
- Update progress on KRs
- Learning: What's working? What's not?
- Adjust next week's approach

**Without weekly cadence → OKRs die!** (Wodtke's #1 Rule)

---

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### Wodtke's 5 Deadly Mistakes (AVOID!)
1. ❌ **Set & Forget** → Weekly tracking is NON-NEGOTIABLE!
2. ❌ **Goal-of-Week Whiplash** → Don't change OKRs mid-quarter!
3. ❌ **Too Many OKRs** → 1 Objective, 3-5 KRs max!
4. ❌ **Micromanaging** → Trust yourself, focus on outcomes
5. ❌ **All at Once** → Start with pilot, iterate!

### Red Team Check
**Ask yourself weekly:**
- Can I game these KRs? (If YES → add quality gates!)
- Can I achieve this without business impact? (If YES → rewrite!)
- Am I measuring activities or outcomes? (Outcomes only!)

### OKRs ≠ Performance Review
**Remember:**
- OKRs = Stretch goals (designed to sometimes fail)
- Performance = Job expectations (must hit)
- NEVER conflate them or you'll sandbag immediately!

## CURRENT_WEEK.md (Lightweight Current Week View)

This is the **Single Source of Truth for the current week** - automatically loaded in every session via `@import`.

**Location:** `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md`

**Purpose:**
- Lightweight view (50 lines vs 300 lines!)
- Always visible in Claude's context
- Updated every Monday (commitments) & Friday (wins)
- Keeps User and Claude aligned on weekly focus

**CRITICAL:** The `quarter:` field in front matter is the **Single Source of Truth** for the active quarter!
- okr-monday and okr-friday skills read this field to find the main OKR file
- Example: `quarter: Q1 2026` → Skills will load `Q1-2026-OKRs.md`

```markdown

week: [number]
period: [date range]

## Usage Notes

### Determine Current Quarter

**From current date:**
- Q1 = January - March
- Q2 = April - June
- Q3 = July - September
- Q4 = October - December

**Example:** If today is January 15, 2026 → Q1-2026.md

### When okr-expert Creates OKRs

**Creates 2 files:**
1. `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/Q{X}-{YYYY}.md` (main archive, all weeks - e.g., Q1-2026.md)
2. `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md` (Week 1 initialized)

### When okr-monday Updates (Every Monday)

**Updates 2 files:**
1. `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/Q{X}-{YYYY}.md` (Week X section)
2. `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md` (new commitments, move to Week X+1)

### When okr-friday Updates (Every Friday)

**Updates 2 files:**
1. `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/Q{X}-{YYYY}.md` (mark checkboxes, add wins/learning)
2. `/projects/business-strategy/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md` (mark checkboxes, update progress)

---

## File Relationship

```
Q{X}-{YYYY}.md (Archive)
    ↓
CURRENT_WEEK.md (View)
    ↓
Claude's Context (@import in CLAUDE.md)
    ↓
Proactive OKR-Awareness in Sessions
```

**Key Principle:** Single Source of Truth
- Main data lives in Q{X}-{YYYY}.md (e.g., Q1-2026.md)
- CURRENT_WEEK.md is a **derived view** (current week only)
- Both updated in sync by Skills (Monday/Friday)
